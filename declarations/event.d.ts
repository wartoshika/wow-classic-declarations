   * - 1) Target enemy. Event is fired as some spells that require rage become marked as unusable. On the action bar the spell is marked in red as unusable.
   * - 2) Use Enrage to gain rage. Event is fired as we now have enough rage. On the action bar the spell is marked unusable as out of range.
   * - 3) Move into range. Event is not fired. On the action bar the spell is marked usable.
   * - 4) Rage runs out. Event is fired as we no longer have enough rage.
   * - 5) Remove target. Event is fired and spell is marked as useable on action bar.
