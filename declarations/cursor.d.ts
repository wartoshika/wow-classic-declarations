 * @param bagId id of the bag the slot is located in
 * @param slot slot inside the bag (top left slot is 1, slot to the right of it is 2)
 * @description The function behaves differently depending on what is currently on the cursor
 * - If the cursor currently has nothing, calling this will pick up an item from your backpack
 * - If the cursor currently contains an item (check with CursorHasItem()), calling this will place the item currently on the cursor into the
 * specified bag slot. If there is already an item in that bag slot, the two items will be exchanged
 * - If the cursor is set to a spell (typically enchanting and poisons, check with SpellIsTargeting()), calling this specifies that you want to
 * cast the spell on the item in that bag slot
 * - Trying to pickup the same item twice in the same "time tick" does not work (client seems to flag the item as "locked" and waits for the server
 * to sync). This is only a problem if you might move a single item multiple times (i.e., if you are changing your character's equipped armor, you
 * are not likely to move a single piece of armor more than once). If you might move an object multiple times in rapid succession, you can check the
 * item's 'locked' flag by calling GetContainerItemInfo. If you want to do this, you should leverage OnUpdate to help you. Avoid constantly checking
 * the lock status inside a tight loop. If you do, you risk getting into a race condition. Once the repeat loop starts running, the client will not
 * get any communication from the server until it finishes. However, it will not finish until the server tells it that the item is unlocked.
